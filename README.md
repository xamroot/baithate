# BaitHate - Clickbait Identification
"You won't BELIEVE how great this extension is."

Let's be honest - we've all been there. You see that headline that you know you shouldn't click, but you just can't resist. You fell for clickbait.

Clickbait is a manipulative practice the litters the web and pollutes your browser with noise. 

We developed BaitHate to help identify clickbait at a glance and get back to cleaner browsing.
