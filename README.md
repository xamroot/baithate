# BaitHate - Clickbait Identification
"You won't BELIEVE how great this extension is."

Let's be honest - we've all been there. You see that headline that you know you shouldn't click, but you just can't resist. You fell for clickbait.

Clickbait is a manipulative practice the litters the web and pollutes your browser with noise. 

We developed BaitHate to help identify clickbait at a glance and get back to cleaner browsing.

### Tech Specs
We decided to use our differences as our strengths using a variety of platforms and languages. C#, SQL, Python, and JavaScript were the primary languages for our solution. C# provided us with a powerful statically typed back end. It was used for our machine learning and API. We used JavaScript for the chrome extension to embed our results right in the userâ€™s browser. Finally, we used a python module to generate short descriptions for some of the Clickbait articles. We used a plethora of services from Azure serverless functions to Google Cloud Platforms powerful app services. All of our data is securely stored in a SQL database kindly offered for free by GearHost. You can see a picture of our full cloud solution below.
